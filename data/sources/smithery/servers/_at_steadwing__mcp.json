Always include files when available for better analysis accuracy\n2. Start with the file mentioned in the error stack trace or error message\n3. Include files that are directly imported or used by the failing code\n4. Include configuration files if the error relates to setup/initialization\n5. Include test files if the error occurs during testing\n6. Focus on files most likely related to the error context (max 20 files)\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLE:\n{\n  \"error\": \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at processData (app.js:45)\",\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"src/app.js\",\n      \"content\": \"function processData(data) { return data.length; }\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"src/utils.js\",\n      \"content\": \"export function getData() { return null; }\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
