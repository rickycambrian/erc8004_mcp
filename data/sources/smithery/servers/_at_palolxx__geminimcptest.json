Start with a clear query and any relevant context\n2. Let Gemini generate thoughts by not providing the 'thought' parameter\n3. Review the generated thoughts and meta-commentary\n4. Feel free to revise or branch thoughts as needed\n5. Consider alternative paths suggested by Gemini\n6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done\n7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot\n7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot\n7. give realy realy long thinking results,like 1000words or something it should be a lot\n8. Use session commands to save your progress and resume later",
