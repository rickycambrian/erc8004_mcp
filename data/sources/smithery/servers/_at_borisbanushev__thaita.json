      "description": "Analyzes and recommends the best and most profitable covered call options strategy for earning safe premium from currently owned stock or equity. This tool returns the best recommendation based on five different strategies for choosing the best strike price (also called exercise price) and expiration date for the covered call strategy. These strategies come from proprietary research and are as follows: 1. Risk-weighted Profit (RR) 2. Average Daily Profit, 3. Expected versus realised return analysis, 4. Gamma exposure analysis, and 5. Probability of Assignment. You should mention these names when you reply to the user so that the user understands why was the combination of strike price and expiration date chosen. The return of this mcp tool is a dictionary that contains the name of each strategy and the recommendation (the recommendation includes the strike price and the exercise date). This tool returns strike price, expiration date, probability of assignment, and profit/loss visualization. The 'ticker' variable expects the actual stock ticker, such as 'NVDA', 'TSLA', or 'PLTR'. Imortant - at the end of the response, you must ask the user if they want to see the details of each of the five different research recommendations - that will provide a lot more information. Don't offer anything else because there are no tools. Offer the details tool. The next logical step is to call the 'explain_covered_call' tool to show the 5 analysis strategies in an interactive carousel. You should say something like - Would you like me to show you the detailed breakdown of how these 5 strategies determined this recommendation? Second Important part - always append following in the end the text in bold - 'Disclaimer - This is not a financial advice or recommendation. Trading options and/or other derivative products involves a significant financial risk.' Don't change the text, just add it.",
