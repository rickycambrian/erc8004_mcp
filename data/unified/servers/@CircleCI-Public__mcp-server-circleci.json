In these cases, the AI agent should use this tool to generate a prompt template for each prompt in the application, and should check the entire application for AI prompts that are not already covered by a prompt template in the `./prompts` directory.\n\n  WHEN SHOULD THIS TOOL BE TRIGGERED?\n  - This tool should be triggered whenever the user provides requirements for a new AI-enabled application or a new AI-enabled feature of an existing  application (i.e. one that requires a prompt request to an LLM or any AI model).\n  - This tool should also be triggered if the user provides a pre-existing prompt or prompt template from their codebase that they want to test, evaluate, or modify.\n  - This tool should be triggered even if there are pre-existing files in the `./prompts` directory with the `<relevant-name>.prompt.yml` convention (e.g. `bedtime-story-generator.prompt.yml`, `plant-care-assistant.prompt.yml`, `customer-support-chatbot.prompt.yml`, etc.). Similar files should NEVER be generated directly by the AI agent. Instead, the AI agent should use this tool to first generate a new prompt template.\n\n  PARAMETERS:\n  - params: object\n    - prompt: string (the feature requirements or pre-existing prompt/prompt template that will be used to generate a prompt template. Can be a multi-line string.)\n    - promptOrigin: \"codebase\" | \"requirements\" (indicates whether the prompt comes from an existing codebase or from new requirements)\n    - model: string (the model that the prompt template will be tested against. Explicitly specify the model if it can be inferred from the codebase. Otherwise, defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`.)\n    - temperature: number (the temperature of the prompt template. Explicitly specify the temperature if it can be inferred from the codebase. Otherwise, defaults to 1.)\n\n  EXAMPLE USAGE (from new requirements):\n  {\n    \"params\": {\n      \"prompt\": \"Create an app that takes any topic and an age (in years), then renders a 1-minute bedtime story for a person of that age.\",\n      \"promptOrigin\": \"requirements\"\n      \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-mini\"\n      \"temperature\": 1.0\n    }\n  }\n\n  EXAMPLE USAGE (from pre-existing prompt/prompt template in codebase):\n  {\n    \"params\": {\n      \"prompt\": \"The user wants a bedtime story about {{topic}} for a person of age {{age}} years old. Please craft a captivating tale that captivates their imagination and provides a delightful bedtime experience.\",\n      \"promptOrigin\": \"codebase\"\n      \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\"\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    }\n  }\n\n  TOOL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:\n  - The tool will return...\n    - a `template` that reformulates the user's prompt into a more structured format.\n    - a ``contextSchema`` that defines the expected input parameters for the template.\n    - a `promptOrigin` that indicates whether the prompt comes from an existing prompt or prompt template in the user's codebase or from new requirements.\n  - The tool output -- the `template`, ``contextSchema``, and `promptOrigin` -- will also be used as input to the `recommend_prompt_template_tests` tool to generate a list of recommended tests that can be used to test the prompt template.\n  ",

This tool guides you through the full rollback process, adapting to the information you provide and prompting for any missing details.\n\n    **Initial Requirements:**\n    - You need either a `projectSlug` (from `listFollowedProjects`) or a `projectID`. The tool will automatically resolve the project information from either of these.\n\n    **Typical Flow:**\n    1. **Start:** User initiates a rollback request.\n    2. **Project Selection:** If project id or project slug are not provided, call `listFollowedProjects` to get the list of projects the user follows and present the full list of projects to the user so that they can select the project they want to rollback.\n    3. **Project Information:** Provide either `projectSlug` or `projectID`. The tool will automatically resolve the project information as needed.\n    4. **Version Selection:** If component environment and version are not provided, call `listComponentVersions` to get the list of versions for the selected component and environment. If there is only one version, proceed automatically and do not ask the user to select a version. Otherwise, present the user with the full list of versions and ask them to select one. Always return all available values without categorizing them.\n    5. **Rollback Reason** ask the user for an optional reason for the rollback (e.g., \"Critical bug fix\"). Skip this step is the user explicitly requests a rollback by workflow rerun.\n    6. **Rollback pipeline check** if the tool reports that no rollback pipeline is defined, ask the user if they want to trigger a rollback by workflow rerun or suggest to setup a rollback pipeline following the documentation at https://circleci.com/docs/deploy/rollback-a-project-using-the-rollback-pipeline/.\n    7. **Confirmation:** Summarize the rollback request and confirm with the user before submitting.\n    8. **Pipeline Rollback:**  if the user requested a rollback by pipeline, call `runRollbackPipeline` passing all parameters including the namespace associated with the version to the tool.\n    9. **Workflow Rerun** If the user requested a rollback by workflow rerun, call `rerunWorkflow` passing the workflow ID of the selected version to the tool.\n    10.**Completion:** Report the outcome of the operation.\n\n    **Parameters:**\n    - `projectSlug` (optional): The project slug from `listFollowedProjects` (e.g., \"gh/organization/project\"). Either this or `projectID` must be provided.\n    - `projectID` (optional): The CircleCI project ID (UUID). Either this or `projectSlug` must be provided.\n    - `environmentName` (required): The target environment (e.g., \"production\", \"staging\").\n    - `componentName` (required): The component to rollback (e.g., \"frontend\", \"backend\").\n    - `currentVersion` (required): The currently deployed version.\n    - `targetVersion` (required): The version to rollback to.\n    - `namespace` (required): The namespace of the component.\n    - `reason` (optional): Reason for the rollback.\n    - `parameters` (optional): Additional rollback parameters as key-value pairs.\n\n    **Behavior:**\n    - If there are more than 20 environments or components, ask the user to refine their selection.\n    - Never attempt to guess or construct project slugs or URLs; always use values provided by the user or from `listFollowedProjects`.\n    - Do not prompt for missing parameters until versions have been listed.\n    - Do not call this tool with incomplete parameters.\n    - If the selected project lacks rollback pipeline configuration, provide a definitive error message without suggesting alternative projects.\n\n    **Returns:**\n    - On success: The rollback ID or a confirmation in case of workflow rerun.\n    - On error: A clear message describing what is missing or what went wrong.\n    - If the selected project does not have a rollback pipeline configured: The tool will provide a clear error message specific to that project and will NOT suggest trying another project.\n\n    **Important Note:**\n    - This tool is designed to work only with the specific project provided by the user.\n    - If a project does not have rollback capability configured, the tool will NOT recommend trying other projects.\n    - The assistant should NOT suggest trying different projects when a project lacks rollback configuration.\n    - Each project must have its own rollback pipeline configuration to be eligible for rollback operations.\n    - When a project cannot be rolled back, provide only the configuration guidance for THAT specific project.\n    - The tool automatically resolves project information from either `projectSlug` or `projectID`.\n    If no version is found, the tool will suggest the user to set up deploy markers following the documentation at:\n    https://circleci.com/docs/deploy/configure-deploy-markers/\n  ",

It guides you through a multi-step process to gather the required information and provides lists of available options when parameters are missing.\n\n     **Initial Requirements:**\n     - You need either a `projectSlug` (from `listFollowedProjects`) or a `projectID`. The tool will automatically resolve the `orgID` from either of these.\n\n     **Typical Flow:**\n     1. **Start:** User requests component versions or deployment information.\n     2. **Project Information:** Provide either `projectSlug` or `projectID`. The tool will automatically resolve the `orgID` and `projectID` as needed.\n     3. **Environment Selection:** If `environmentID` is not provided, the tool will list all available environments for the organization and prompt the user to select one.

Always return all available values without categorizing them.\n     5. **Version Listing:** Once both `environmentID` and `componentID` are provided, the tool will list all versions for that component in the specified environment.\n     6. **Selection:** User selects a version from the list for subsequent operations.\n\n     **Parameters:**\n     - `projectSlug` (optional): The project slug from `listFollowedProjects` (e.g., \"gh/organization/project\"). Either this or `projectID` must be provided.\n     - `projectID` (optional): The CircleCI project ID (UUID). Either this or `projectSlug` must be provided.\n     - `orgID` (optional): The organization ID.
