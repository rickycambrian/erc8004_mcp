IMPORTANT: Before calling this tool, determine fiatType from the user's country/fiat using Onramp's `fetchAllCountryConfig` API (`/onramp/api/v2/common/public/fetchAllCountryConfig`). Ask the user for their country or local currency, then select the appropriate active entry from `data.buy` and use its key as fiatType (e.g., '1' for INR/India, '21' for USD/US).
