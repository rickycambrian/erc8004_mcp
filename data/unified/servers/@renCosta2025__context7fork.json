Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for\n2. Return the most relevant match based on:\n- Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized)\n- Description relevance to the query's intent\n- Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts)\n- Trust score (consider libraries with scores of 7-10 more authoritative)\n\nResponse Format:\n- Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section\n- Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen\n- If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one\n- If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements\n\nFor ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match.",
