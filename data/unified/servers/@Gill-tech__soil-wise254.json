  "description": "SoilWise is an AI + IoT-powered agricultural system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions for better yield, sustainability, and profitability. Using soil sensors, satellite imagery, and market data, the platform evaluates soil health, predicts rainfall trends, and recommends optimal crop and fertilizer plans \u2014 while also scoring farm-level financial and sustainability performance.\n\nIt combines six smart modules:\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Soil Analysis: Automated detection of soil type, pH, and nutrient balance.\n\n\ud83c\udf3e AgriShield: Disease recognition and treatment recommendation using computer vision.\n\n\ud83d\udca7 IrrigAIte: Smart irrigation planning based on moisture data and local weather.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Yield Predictor: ML-powered yield forecasting and credit scoring for farmers.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 AgriChat: Conversational assistant for personalized advice.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Research Checker: Validates agricultural research claims using AI evidence synthesis.\n\n\ud83e\udde9 MCP Architecture Flow\nINPUTS \n\u2193\n[MCP Logic Layer]\n\u2193\nOUTPUTS\n\n\nInput Layer:\n\n1.Soil sensor data (pH, moisture, nutrients)\n\n2.Satellite imagery and weather forecasts\n\n3.Farmer financial & field data (size, crop history)\n\n4.Market data from open agri APIs\n\nMCP Logic Layer:\n\n1.Data preprocessing & cleaning\n\n2.AI models (soil classification, disease detection, rainfall prediction)\n\n3.Predictive analytics for yield and credit scoring\n\n4.Generative AI for chatbot and recommendations\n\nOutput Layer:\n\n1.Personalized crop and fertilizer plans\n\n2.Financial risk and creditworthiness insights\n\n3.Rainfall and yield forecasts (3-month horizon)\n\n4.Interactive chatbot responses and visual dashboards\n\n\u2699\ufe0f What the MCP Does\n\nThe MCP acts as the intelligent orchestration layer that links soil data, AI models, and farmer interfaces.\nIt performs:\n\n1.Real-time soil and satellite data processing\n\n2.Cross-model inference for health and yield prediction\n\n3.Dynamic decision generation (recommendations, warnings, or irrigation plans)\n\n4.Data logging for continuous model improvement\n\n\ud83d\udd17 How It Connects to the Client\n\nFrontend: Streamlit dashboard and SMS interface (via Africa\u2019s Talking)\n\nMCP Server: Python backend (FastAPI + Streamlit) hosted on Azure Cloud MCP Node\n\nData Pipelines: Pulls from satellite APIs (Google Earth Engine), local sensor input, and OpenAI for natural language reasoning\n\nClient Access: Farmers, agronomists, and cooperatives can log in or subscribe via mobile or web for real-time guidance\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why It\u2019s Useful or Creative\n\n1.Transforms soil and environmental data into instant, actionable insights \u2014 no labs or delays.\n\n2.Integrates AI, IoT, and financial scoring, giving farmers a holistic view of soil health + profitability.\n\n3.Localized intelligence: Tailored to microclimates and soil types in Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa (Tunisia pilot).\n\n4.Scalable Design: Modular MCP architecture supports easy deployment across regions and languages.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Financial & Credit Scoring Module\n\na.Uses soil productivity metrics and yield forecasts to estimate farmer creditworthiness.\n\nb.Generates a SoilWise Credit Score to help farmers access loans or subsidies.\n\nPredictive metrics include:\n\n1.Historical yield potential\n\n2.Input efficiency\n\n3.Sustainability index\n\n4.Financial resilience model\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Deployment\n\na.Prototype Deployed: https://soilwise-prototype.streamlit.app/soilwise\n\nb.Backend Host: Azure Cloud with integrated MCP server\n\nc.Regions Tested: Western & Central Kenya (pilot), expanding to Tunisia for semi-arid adaptation\n\nd.Data Sources: Open Data Africa, Google Earth Engine, FAO Soil Database\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 Repository\n\n\ud83d\udd17 GitHub: https://github.com/antonie-riziki/SoilWise\n\n\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Tags / Categories\n\n#AI #Agritech #IoT #MCP #SoilHealth #ClimateResilience #SustainableFarming #CreditScoring",
