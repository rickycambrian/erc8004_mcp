Supports multiple graph types such as topology, timeline, changelog, requirement documentation, etc. Design guidelines for each graph type:\n- topology: Used to represent dependencies between system components and modules. Recommended to first create main module nodes, then add component nodes, and finally represent relationships through edges like calls, dependencies, and containment\n- timeline: Used to record important project events and decisions. Recommended to add event nodes in chronological order and link related personnel and decisions\n- changelog: Used to track change history of features and components. Recommended to create nodes for each significant change, marking change types and impact scope\n- requirement: Used for requirement management and tracking. Recommended to first create high-level requirements, then break down into specific features, and finally link to responsible persons and iterations\n- knowledge_base: Used to build domain knowledge systems. Recommended to start from core concepts and gradually expand related concepts and relationships\n- ontology: Used for formal representation of domain concepts and relationships, suitable for building standardized knowledge models",
